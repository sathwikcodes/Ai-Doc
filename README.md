## Features

- **Document Upload**: Upload documents in various formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX) to the platform.
- **AI Document Analysis**: Use AI models to analyze and understand the content of uploaded documents.
- **Chat Interface**: Engage in conversations with AI models to ask questions or discuss the content of documents.
- **Experimental Features**: Explore experimental features and functionalities as we continue to develop and refine the platform.

## How to Use

1. **Upload Documents**: Upload documents that you want to analyze and interact with using the chat interface.

2. **Start Chatting**: Initiate a conversation with the AI model by typing your questions or comments in the chat interface.

3. **Explore Features**: Experiment with different features and functionalities of the platform and provide feedback on your experience.

## Future Plans

- Enhance AI models for better document analysis and understanding.
- Implement additional features such as document summarization, keyword extraction, and more.
